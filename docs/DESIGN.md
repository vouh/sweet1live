## Brand & Style

The design system is a "Nocturnal Editorial" aesthetic designed for Sweet1neLIVE. It prioritises high-contrast cinematic visuals, evoking the atmosphere of a premium jazz club or high-end evening lounge. The personality is sophisticated, mature, and entertainment-led, moving away from high-energy "club" tropes towards a more curated, late-night performance experience.

The style is a blend of **Minimalism** and **Tactile Luxury**. It relies on deep blacks, warm champagne golds, and expansive whitespace (or "blackspace") to create a sense of exclusivity. Visual elements are refined with thin, hairline borders and generous letter spacing to evoke a sense of quiet confidence and premium service.

## Colors

The palette is anchored in a "Nocturnal" base. The primary background (#050505) provides a deep, near-black canvas that allows photography and gold accents to pop.

- **Brand Gold (#D8B632):** Used sparingly for primary calls to action, active states, and brand highlights.
- **Soft Ivory (#F7F3EA):** Used for primary typography to ensure high readability without the harshness of pure white.
- **Surface Tiers:** Use #111111 for cards and sections, and #191714 for interactive elements or secondary containers to provide subtle depth without traditional shadows.
- **Functional Colors:** Success and Error states are heavily desaturated to remain cohesive with the luxurious atmosphere.

## Typography

This design system uses a high-contrast typographic pairing to balance editorial flair with modern utility.

- **Headlines:** Bodoni Moda provides a high-contrast, elegant serif look. Use it for performance titles, menu categories, and emotive marketing copy.
- **Body & UI:** Hanken Grotesk is a clean, contemporary sans-serif. It handles all functional data: descriptions, reservation details, and form labels.
- **Editorial Touch:** Use the `label-caps` style for small metadata (e.g., "LIVE MUSIC", "DOORS OPEN") with generous letter spacing to enhance the premium feel.
- **Currency:** Prices should be set in Bodoni Moda to elevate them from functional text to a premium detail.

## Layout & Spacing

The layout philosophy is **Editorial and Spacious**. It avoids the cramped density of typical web apps, opting for a relaxed, rhythmic flow that mirrors a high-end physical programme.

- **Grid:** Use a 12-column fluid grid for desktop with 24px gutters.
- **Sectioning:** Vertical spacing is intentionally large (120px on desktop) to allow high-quality photography to "breathe" between content blocks.
- **Alignment:** Centralise primary headlines and call-to-actions to create a sense of formal presentation.
- **Mobile:** Reflow to a single column with 20px side margins. Maintain significant vertical gaps between elements to preserve the premium feel on smaller screens.

## Elevation & Depth

This design system eschews heavy shadows in favour of **Tonal Layering** and **Fine Outlines**.

- **Depth:** Surfaces are defined by their hex values (#050505 to #111111). Higher elevation is represented by lighter, warmer dark-tones, not shadows.
- **Borders:** Use the `border_gold` (rgba(216,182,50,0.28)) for all card boundaries and separators. These should be 1px "hairline" strokes.
- **Active State:** Rather than a shadow, an active card or focused input should increase its border opacity or transition to a solid #D8B632 stroke.
- **Atmospheric Depth:** Use soft, large-scale radial gradients (Brand Gold at 5% opacity) behind key images to simulate warm ambient spotlighting.

## Shapes

The shape language is **Refined and Structured**. 

- **Corners:** A `0.25rem` (4px) radius is used for standard UI components like buttons and inputs. This provides a "softened architectural" look that is cleaner than sharp corners but more professional than round ones.
- **Imagery:** Large hero images should remain sharp (0px radius) to maintain a cinematic, edge-to-edge feel.
- **Interactive Elements:** Use the `Soft` setting for small components (chips, tags) to distinguish them from the more rigid layout structure.

## Components

### Buttons
- **Primary:** Brand Gold background (#D8B632) with near-black text (#050505). No shadows. 4px rounded corners.
- **Secondary:** Transparent background with a 1px Soft Ivory border. Text in Soft Ivory.
- **Tertiary/Action:** Soft Ivory text with a 1px underline positioned 4px below the baseline. On hover, the underline should expand or change colour to Brand Gold.

### Cards & Surfaces
- **Performance Card:** Surface Elevated (#111111) with a hairline gold border. Images should be the primary focus, with Bodoni Moda headlines.
- **Menu Items:** Use a simple list format with the price in Brand Gold. Avoid card containers for menus; use whitespace and subtle dividers instead.

### Inputs & Forms
- **Fields:** Surface Secondary (#191714) with an Ivory label above. The border should only appear on focus, using the Brand Gold.
- **Checkboxes:** Square with a 2px radius. When checked, the fill is Brand Gold with a dark tick.

### Feedback & Motion
- **Transitions:** Use "Long & Smooth" transitions (400ms ease-out) for page reveals.
- **Hover States:** Elements should subtly shift in opacity or brightness rather than scale or move, maintaining a "still and calm" interface.
- **Icons:** Use thin-stroke (1px) linear icons in Soft Ivory. Avoid filled or "playful" icon sets.
